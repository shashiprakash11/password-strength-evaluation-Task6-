Evaluation of different passwords using online password strength tools and finding strengths and weakness in passwords .Researched on common password attacks like brute force &amp; Dictionary. 
# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation

This is a small project I did to actually *see* what makes a password strong instead of just reading the theory. I created different passwords (weak → medium → strong → passphrases), tested them on free password strength tools, and noted down the results.

## 🌟 Why I Did This

We always hear “make strong passwords,” but what does that really mean? How much difference does adding a number, symbol, or extra word make? This project helped me explore that and document the findings in a simple way.

## 📊 What I Did

1. Created sample passwords with different levels of complexity.
2. Tested each on online password strength checkers.
3. Recorded the **score, estimated crack time, and feedback**.
4. Wrote a humanised report with results, tips, and lessons learned.

## 📑 Key Learnings

* Longer passwords = way harder to crack.
* Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters really helps.
* Passphrases (like *My$Dog_Runs@Fast!2025*) are both strong **and** easier to remember.
* Avoid dictionary words and personal info — they get cracked super fast.
* Password managers make life easier and safer.

## 🖼 Screenshots

Screenshots of test results (with passwords **redacted**) are saved in the `captures/` folder.

---

## 🚀 Future Ideas

* Automate password testing with a script.
* Compare multiple password checker tools.
* Add visual graphs of password strength vs complexity.

## ⚠️ Note

All passwords in this repo are **examples only**. Do **not** use them in real life. Always keep your real credentials private and secure.
